## Multi Cloud Image Processing Web Application

In this project, we would be creating a multi cloud image processing web application. In a cloud monthly coding chanllenge, it was asked to create a image processing website which would be multi-cloud in nature. This project is comprised off below three major cloud providers.

1. AWS
2. Azure
3. GCP

### AWS 
We would be using AWS for image storage and  stitching togather web application interaction with other services.
- AWS S3 for Image Storage and Lambda Code Artificats.
- AWS Lambda for eventing the image processing application and providing secure access to S3 bucket.
- AWS API Gateway will be publishing the API for Web Application.

### Azure
We would be using Azure for image analysis.
- Azure Conginitive Service ( Computer Vision API) will be used for image processing.

### GCP
GCP would be used for realtime database.
- GCP Firestore for realtime database.
